# print(binary)


'''7.) Is Prime?: You are given an integer n. Print yes, if it is a prime number. Print no, if it is not a prime number.
Sample Input 1: 
49
Sample Output 1: 
No
Sample Input 2: 
37
Sample Output 2: 
Yes'''
# n=int(input("Enter numbers: "))
# if (n<2) or (n>2 and n%2==0):
#     prime="No"
# elif n==2:
#     prime="Yes"
# else:
#     i=2
#     while i<=(n//2):
#         if n%i==0:

#             break
#         i+=1
#     else:
#         prime="Yes"    
# print(prime)


'''8.) Is Perfect Number?: You are given an integer n. Print yes, if it is a Perfect Number. Print no, if it is not a Perfect Number.
A Perfect Number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself.
Sample Input 1: 
28
Sample Output 1: 
Yes
Explanation 1: The factors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28. We don't consider the number itself. 28 = 1+2+4+7+14.
Sample Input 2: 
24
Sample Output 2: 
No
Explanation 2: The factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. We don't consider the number itself. But 24 != 1+2+3+4+6+8+12.'''

# i=1
# sum=0
# while i<=(n//2):
#     if n%i==0:
#         sum+=i
#     i+=1
# ans= "Yes" if sum==n else "No"
# print(ans)


'''9.) Is Armstrong Number?: You are given an integer n. Print yes, if it is an Armstrong Number. Print no, if it is not an Armstrong Number.
An Armstrong Number is a positive number that equals the sum of its digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits.
Sample Input 1: 
1634
Sample Output 1: 
Yes
Explanation 1: 1634 has 4 digits, so we raise each digit to the power of 4. 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4 = 1 + 1296 + 81 + 256 = 1634 
Sample Input 2: 
153
Sample Output 2: 
Yes
Explanation 2: 153 has 3 digits, so we raise each digit to the power of 3. 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153'''

# a=n
# l=len(str(n))
# sum=0
