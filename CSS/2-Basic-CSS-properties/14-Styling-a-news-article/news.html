        <h2>Paris 2024 Olympics: How ‘Superman’ PR Sreejesh proved to be Indian hockey’s saviour again in thrilling win over GB</h2>
        <p>Like an Avenger grabbing his gears before flying off to protect the planet, PR Sreejesh takes his helmet, picks up his stick, hangs the heavily padded glove on it and swaggers onto the field to save his team. He smiles at his teammates; and stares in the direction of the opponents. This walk, the 25 steps from the dugout to the goal, is when the showman transforms into a saviour. When Conor Williamson started his bending run into the ‘D’ from the right, Sreejesh lunged forward, shuffled his feet and slid. The attacker is pushed away from the goal and the ball is put over it. Phil Roper tried to deceive, first going wide out, then coming in; dribbling and hoping that Sreejesh would commit. Like a giant bird flapping its wings, Sreejesh marched out but the goalkeeper didn’t fall for the bluff. When Roper goes for a reverse hit, Sreejesh falls on his backside and stops the ball from going in.</p>
        <p>The quarterfinal against Britain, which India won 4-2 via penalty shootouts, was the 23rd time Sreejesh stood in the goal for India for a shoot-out. His success rate is staggering — on 13 of those occasions, he has led India to a win. “Superman,” exclaimed one British coach, watching from the stands. The ‘superman’s last-second intervention, against Germany in the bronze medal playoff, paved India’s path to the podium for the first time in three decades in Tokyo. In his final tournament, he brought India a step closer to another Olympic medal. It’s tough to imagine an Indian side without Sreejesh. With him in the goal, the players have a sense of wearing a bullet-proof vest, allowing them to indulge in risks they otherwise might not.</p>
        <p>Like the whole strategy on Sunday when, after being down to 10 men, they pushed Britain to wider areas knowing full well that their runs from the baseline could result in penalty corners. “But if we conceded penalty corners, it was okay because we had faith in Sreejesh. He is one of the best goalkeepers,” vice-captain Hardik Singh said. Coach Craig Fulton said Sreejesh was ‘immense’. Manpreet Singh, the only other player in this squad to play in four Olympics, is ready to take any number of blows if it means Sreejesh walks into the sunset with a medal hanging around his neck.</p>
